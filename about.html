            <h1><b>About</b></h1>
            <p>The forestlands of Fralk were a vast and sprawling country housing thousands of communities and species of wildlife. The outer circles of the forest were densely populated, almost city-like communities of forest folk who dominantly lived in cohabitation with the natural world. But, after thousands of years of Fralkan life, an unprecedented and unanticipated blizzard buried the entire forest in over a hundred feet of snow. In the present day, a decade after the blizzard, recovery efforts are still underway to thaw Fralk, rescue survivors, and identify the cause of the Great Burial.

              Recovered in this exhibit are the belongings of what is believed to be a sole adventurer into Xirat, the largely unexplored and dangerous heart of Fralk. The objects were discovered in a backpack almost completely preserved underneath the snow. This creature is believed to have been a traveler from Thifth, an isolated, monastic community from the fringes of Fralk. Why this creature's belongings were found outside Xirat is unknown. Although the owner may never be identified, their belongings are some of the best preserved artifacts from the Great Burial and provide deep insights into the lost societies of Fralk.
