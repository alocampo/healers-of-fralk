            <p>This project was made by Alexander Ocampo as part of the University of Pittsburgh's DNID capstone sequence.</p>

            <p><em>People They Carry: Healers of Fralk</em> is an ongoing project that aims to explore remediation, representation, and how we're told stories. By using the medium of a museum exhibit, I intend to explore how people can be represented by the things in their life, and how those things then are presented to us when we can't actually engage with them first hand. Each object in the museum collection will be made physically. I intend to carefully consider how these objects are documented--how they're described, how they're photographed, how they're broken down into their indivisual stories--in order to create an exploratory narrative experience for viewers.</p>

            <p>I would like to thank Dr. Jessica FitzPatrick for her work throughout the semester guiding us all through our individual projects. I would also like to thank Dr. Jane Thaler and Dr. Amanda Awanjo for their insights as I explored into the field of archival studies.</p>
